- This is the working version for figure plotting utils for the repo v1_depth_map, written for the biorxiv submission of the manuscript "A depth map of visual space in the primary visual cortex" on Sept 27th, 2024.

## v2.0.2
### Major changes
- Move core analysis code from v1_depth_map to cottage_analysis:
    - Added plotting functions and plotting utils to the `plotting` package.
