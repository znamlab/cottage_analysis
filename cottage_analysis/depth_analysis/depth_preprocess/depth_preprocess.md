Preprocessing for depth 2p experiments.
Main scripts:
    - find_depth_neurons.py
Functions include:
    - align timestamps (imaging_frames, parameters, mousez) --> this is trial-based analysis so does not include the monitor frame no. in the timestamps
    - calculate dF/F (to be moved to 2p preprocessing)
    - find depth neurons
